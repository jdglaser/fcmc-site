# :handshake: Inviting Other Players to your Land

## Trusting Members in your Land

Any player who enters your land will not be able to interact with it in any way or attack players unless they are trusted members of your land.

*Note, attacking players is never allowed in a claimed land ([war feature coming soon](declaring_war.md))*

To trust a player in your land, type

```
/lands trust <player_name>
```

*Replace `<player_name>` with the name of the player you want to trust.*

and hit `ENTER`. That player will now be a trusted member of your land.

In the `/lands` menu, click on `Trusted Players` and you should see the member you trusted listed.
