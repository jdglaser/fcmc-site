## Server rules

Mostly, just don't be a dick. 

***Note:** Some dickishness is in fact allowed. However the level of dickishness that shall be permitted will be determined by the admins on a case-by-case basis. If you are curious as to whether or not the level of dickishness of the thing you are about to do is within the server's dickishness level limit, please contact one of the server admins (Jarred or Justin) through discord, or submit an official inquiry with the `Dickishness Level Appeal Form 504(k)` or `Dickishness Level Appeal Form 504(b)` for non-profit organizations (Please allow for between 7-28 business days for the forms to be processed).*

Thank you, and have fun!
